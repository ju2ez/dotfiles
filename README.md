# A dotfile configuration script for Ubuntu and Arch Linux featuring VIM, ZSH, TMUX and more

I couldn't find a nice out-of-the box dotfile script/repo that features all of the above configs and plugins, so I build my own.

*! ENJOY !* Use the Quick-Run for easy installation on Ubuntu or Arch systems (Manjaro approved). 

No warranty for MAC OS X or other Linux/Unix distributions to work.

In order to successfully run the script you should have Ubuntu 18.04 or higher or an up to date Arch Linux derivate.

If you want to adjust the dotfiles you only need to change the files that are in the dotfiles folder and run the script afterwards.
