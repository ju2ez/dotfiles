# A dotfile configuration script for Ubuntu systems featuring VIM, ZSH, TMUX and more

I couldn't find a nice out-of-the box dotfile script/repo that features all of the above configs and plugins, so I build my own.

*! ENJOY !* Use the Quick-Run for easy installation on Ubuntu systems.

No warranty for MAC OS X or other Linux/Unix distributions to work.

In order to successfully run the script you should have Ubuntu 18.04 or higher.

If you want to adjust the dotfiles you only need to change the files that are in the dotfiles folder and run the script afterwards.

 	
## Quick-Run
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/julianhatzky/dotfiles ~/Downloads/dotfiles
chmod a+x ~/Downloads/dotfiles/dotfiles/ubunt/install.sh
sudo ~/Downloads/dotfiles/ubuntu/install.sh


~~~~


# warning

There is no automatic backup function so please save your dotfiles before running the script if needed.
